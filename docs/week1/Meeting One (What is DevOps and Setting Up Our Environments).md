# Meeting One (What is DevOps and Project Roadmap)

Today is going to be about giving a full and detailed overview of exactly what we are going to be doing the next 8 weeks. We are going to then venture into the world of DevOps and why it has become so popular for software companies, and how the Agile mindset has even drifted into other disciplines like logistics. Lastly, we will get into some of the tools that you will need for the next meeting to start building your environments.
